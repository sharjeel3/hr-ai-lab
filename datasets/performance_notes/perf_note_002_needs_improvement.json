            "observation": "Brian's design deliverables for the checkout flow redesign required multiple rounds of revisions. The initial mockups didn't account for mobile responsive design, and accessibility considerations were missing. After feedback, he made the necessary changes, but this delayed the engineering team's start date by a week."
