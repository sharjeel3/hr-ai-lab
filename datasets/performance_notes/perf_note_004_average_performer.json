The Q3 email campaign had average open rates (18%) and click-through rates (2.1%), which are acceptable but not standout. Haven't seen her test new approaches or channels."

            "observation": "Amanda completes assigned tasks reliably but rarely goes beyond what's asked. For example, when I asked her to analyze campaign performance, she provided basic metrics but didn't dig into the 'why' or suggest improvements. She seems to be doing the minimum required rather than driving results."

While not bad ideas, they lacked creativity or differentiation. When I encouraged her to think bigger, she seemed hesitant to take risks. In a competitive market, we need more bold thinking."

I'm concerned about her willingness to invest in professional development. Marketing is evolving rapidly, and continuous learning is essential."

She needs to show more initiative, creativity, and willingness to push boundaries. There's a gap between her current performance and what this role requires, particularly around strategic thinking and innovation.",
